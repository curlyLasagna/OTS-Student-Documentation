## Equipment list 
- If you're lucky, you'll get an accurate TUBOM attached to the ticket that was assigned to you
  - Take a look at the TUBOM and look for the items listed in there that was added. It should list the quantity or have a column that says 'Customer Refurbished'
  - If a TUBOM isn't provided, you'll have to look around the room and compare it whichever is in the virtual tour
- Check the ceiling for these components:
  - Ceiling speakers
  - Microphones 
- There are equipment placed behind displays. 
  - Mostly small form factor computers, Solstice Pods, or small miscellaneous components.
