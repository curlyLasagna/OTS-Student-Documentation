## Equipment list

- If you're lucky, you'll get an accurate TUBOM attached to the ticket that was assigned to you
  - Take a look at the TUBOM and look for the items listed in there that were added. Look for rows with a value in the quantity column or ones that say 'Customer Refurbished'
  - If a TUBOM isn't provided, you'll have to look around the room and compare it whichever is in the virtual tour
- Check the ceiling for these components:
  - Ceiling speakers
  - Microphones 
  - Cameras
- There are components placed behind displays. 
  - Mostly small form factor computers, Solstice Pods, or small miscellaneous components.
