# Email template for room access
When you need to email a person to get into a room.
> Hello Mr/Mrs. &lt;insert last name&gt;  
My name is &lt;Your name&gt;, OTS student employee.  
I wanted to inquire about the availability of &lt;room/list of rooms&gt; so I can take photos and gather data of the audio visual equipment in the room. This allows us to more easily diagnose technical issues if they come up.  
Thanks,
&lt;Your name&gt;

Always CC the appropriate coordinator in your emails.  

# Before visiting a room
1. Check [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) to see if there's a class currently in session
      Last thing you want to do is walk into a class. Don't be that guy/gal
- Some buildings such as Center for the Arts, don't list their schedule on 25Live
2. Take a picture of the wall plate indicating the room number
- Used as a starting point to organize photos. It's faster than organizing by folders on the phone
3. Take a picture of the lock for the room before coming in or after you leave
- Helps with figuring out how to access a room
