# Email template for room access
> Hello Mr/Ms. <insert last name>
My name is <Your name>, OTS student employee
I wanted to inquire about the availability of <room/list of rooms> so I can take photos of the computer equipment of the room to make it easier for our department to troubleshoot in case of an issue. 

Always CC the appropriate coordinator in your emails.  
If unsure, you may CC either [James Hardin](mailto:JHardin@towson.edu) or [Ben Crull](mailto:bcrull@towson.edu)

# Before visiting a room
1. Check [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) to see if there's a class currently in session
      Last thing you want to do is walk into a class. Don't be that guy/gal
- Some buildings such as Center for the Arts, don't list their schedule on 25Live
2. Take a picture of the wall plate indicating the room number
- Used as a starting point
3. Take a picture of the lock for the room before coming in or after you leave
- Helps with figuring out how to acccess a room
