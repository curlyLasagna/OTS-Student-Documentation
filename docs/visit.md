# Before visiting a room

1. Check [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) to see if there's a class currently in session
      Last thing you want to do is walk into a class.

   - Some buildings such as the Center for the Arts, don't list their schedule on 25Live, so it's just a matter of luck.

2. Take a picture of the wall plate indicating the room number

   - The lazy way to organize photos. I approve üëç

3. Take a picture of the lock for the room before coming in or after you leave
   - Helps us know how to get into the room
   - You only have to do this step if it's a new room
