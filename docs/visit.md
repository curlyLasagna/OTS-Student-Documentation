## Before visiting a room
1. Check [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) to see if there's a class currently in session
      Last thing you want to do is walk into a class. Don't be that guy/gal
- Some buildings such as Center for the Arts, don't list their schedule on 25Live
2. Take a picture of the wall plate indicating the room number
- Used as a starting point
3. Take a picture of the lock for the room before coming in or after you leave
- Helps with figuring out how to acccess a room

## Collections
- Identify the room type
  - This step is usually taken care of by whoever assigned you the task. If not, the room is either a conference room, a classroom, or a lab
- Count the number of seats 
  - Count the seats available, whether it's folded, or not
  - Count the number of seats with a computer right in front of it 
  - [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) might give you the number of seats 

## Equipment list 
- If you're lucky, you'll get an accurate TUBOM attached to the ticket that was assigned to you
  - Take a look at the TUBOM and look for the items listed in there that was added. It should list the quantity or have a column that says 'Customer Refurbished'
- If a TUBOM isn't provided, you'll have to look around the room
  - Check the ceiling for these components:
    - Ceiling speakers
    - Microphones

### Instructor workstation/podium/lectern
- Check the sides of the lectern for a drawer. Usually has the document camera.  
- Pull out the drawer and prop up the document camera. 
  - Steps in setting a document camera up is different for each so I'm not going to bother explaining it. Figure it out but if it requires too much force, you're doing it wrong.
- Log in the computer
- If you can't log in, don't stress. Just take a picture of the lock screen
- Go to the webpage of the room's department
  - Consult the virtual tour if you don't know the department
  - Just use the Towson homepage if you're still not sure
