## Before visiting a room
1. Check [25Live](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/towson#!/home/search/location/list) to see if there's a class currently in session
- Last thing you want to do is walk into a class. It's awkward
- Some buildings such as Center for the Arts, don't list their schedule on 25Live.
2. Take a picture of the wall plate indicating the room number
3. Take a picture of the lock for the room

## Collections
- Identify the room type
  - This step is usually taken care of by whoever assigned you the task. If not, the room is either a conference room, a classroom, or a lab
- Count the number of seats 
  - Count the seats available, whether it's folded, or not
  - Count the number of seats with a computer right in front of it 
- List the type of control panel is in the room 

## Equipment list 
- If you're lucky, you'll get an accurate TUBOM attached to the ticket that was assigned to you
  - Take a look at the TUBOM and look for the items listed in there that was added. It should list the quantity or have a note that says 'Customer Refurbished'
