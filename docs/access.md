I'm not a fan of using Microsoft Access but it gets the job done.

## Closing MS Access

- Avoid saying 'yes' when it prompts you to save it. It will save the current filter, so the next person who opens that table will have your filtered list and that might confuse them.

## Importing data into MS Access

- Importing from an excel file may be handy but its error messages are uninformative and the process takes way too long
- I copy the rows in excel that I want to use and just paste it into Access. It should be that simple and it's also easier to see where you mess up

### Creating a copy of .mdb file still points to the same database

I've made the mistake of copying the techInfo.mdb file thinking that I had my own database to play with.
