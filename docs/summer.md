# Summer Room Checks

## What is it?

- Ensures that the data we have for all the applicable rooms in campus are up to date.  
- Quality insurance and reporting problems that were otherwise not accounted for.  
- Vacuum projectors so that when the fall semester starts, there would be less tickets involving projectors overheating (Less work for me!).

## Responsibilities

- Visit the listed rooms
- Perform QA, check [Quality Assurnace](./qa.md) for more details.
- We only have 2 vacuums, so we'll need 2 volunteers to carry vacuums around.  
See [Vacuuming projectors](vacuum.md) for instructions on vacuuming.
