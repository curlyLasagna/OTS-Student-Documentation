## Email template for room access

> Hello Mr/Ms. <insert last name\>.
My name is <Your name\>, OTS student employee.
I wanted to inquire about the availability of <room/list of rooms\> so I can take photos of the computer equipment of the room to make it easier for our department to troubleshoot in case of an issue.

Or just have [Chat Jippity](https://chat.openai.com/) write one for you.
Always CC the appropriate coordinator in your emails.  
If unsure, you may CC either [James Hardin](mailto:JHardin@towson.edu) or [Ben Crull](mailto:bcrull@towson.edu)
