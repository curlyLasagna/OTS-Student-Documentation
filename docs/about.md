# About

I created this guide to make it easy to reference when you're out and about. It's mobile friendly and pretty ðŸ¥°. Hopefully you find this guide useful.  

This guide was made using MkDocs, which uses [Python Markdown](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/python-markdown/)
