# Imaging a computer

## What's an image
Computers on campus are installed with their own specific image, depending on the department.  
If you ever wonder why the computer science department computers have different software that others do not, it's because their computers are installed with their own image and vice versa.

## When to image
- If a computer won't boot or if the current Windows image is being a nuisance.

## Steps
1. Grab a USB stick from Ben. It should contain the software to run Ghost.
   - It should have a happy face sticker on it.
2. Plug the USB stick to the computer.
   1. If you're dealing with a tower, some front usb ports do not function before the O.S. boots, so just try another port.
3. Most of the computers that you'll be dealing with are Dell, so spam the boot override key and boot to the USB stick.
4. The computer will restart and if the screen looks scuffed, then you're good. If it boots to something else, then you repeat the previous step, correctly.
5. In the "GhostCast Session Name to Join" window, enter the room number and select the "Server IP Address" radio button and input in the IP address of the server that you're getting the image from
   - The IP address of the server is department dependent.
6. Select the correct hard drive
7. Select the correct partition. It's usually the biggest partition.
