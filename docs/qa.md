# Quality Assurance

Meant to test the system to ensure that all the options are available and functional.

## Rooms with a control system

### Turn on the system

See [control panels](panels.md) to learn about the different types control panels.  

1. Press start on the touch panel or control system
2. Some panels will prompt you which display to show, or all of them.
   - I usually go with all of them.
3. Displays should start displaying and if it isn't, then we have a problem.

### Log in to the computer

- If there is none, you may skip this step
- In some rooms, a computer may be present but a keyboard or mouse will not be available.
  - Most of these rooms are conference rooms.
  - Bring a keyboard, optionally a mouse.

### Play audio

- Go to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) and play some family friendly tunes.
- As long as there's audio coming out of external speakers, and not from the computer itself, it's all good.

### Test the microphone

- Select the "Microphones" button on the right side of the touch panel.
- Select "Use" on the microphone that you want to use.

### Test the cameras

- Select the "Cameras" button on the right side of the touch panel.
- The way to test out cameras is TBD
- A control page will appear with directions to control the camera.
- If the camera responds to the control and displays an image, it's good.

### Test the document camera

- Document

### Check if the projector output is aligned

- If you can't see certain parts of the screen, then the projector needs to be realigned.

## Rooms without a control system

- Rooms with only a TV display, Solstice Pod, or desktop
  1. Turn on the TV
  2. If you can log in to the computer, It's good. You can log out right away
  3. Switch the input to the Solstice pod.
  4. If the Solstice pod shows the correct time, then it's good.
- Rooms with only a TV display
  1. As long as the TV turns on and displays an image, it's fine
