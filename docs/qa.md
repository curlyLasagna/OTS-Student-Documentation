Meant to test the system to ensure that all the options are available and functional.

## Rooms without a control system

- Rooms with only a TV display, Solstice Pod, or desktop
  1. Turn on the TV
  2. If you can log in to the computer, it's all good. You can log out right away
  3. Switch the input to the Solstice pod.
  4. If the Solstice pod shows the correct time, then it's good.
- Rooms with only a TV display
  1. This is a very rare case and there's not really much that you can do to test it.
  2. As long as the TV turns on, it's fine

## Rooms with a control system

### Turn on the system

1. Press start in the touch panel or control system

### Log in to the computer

  - Most of these rooms are conference rooms.
  - Bring a keyboard, optionally a mouse.

### Play audio
