The cameras in question are not webcams. It's the big ones mounted that are used for recording lectures.  
It can also be used for meetings if the professor is teaching from home.

The Quick-Connect is a hardware responsible for communicating with the camera to provide the user controls to the camera via the control panel

## Common problems

### The power supply

- The power supply for the Quick-Connect could fail, making the camera non-functional
  - If the light on the camera isn't blue, it usually means the power supply failed
  
If all else fails, try the good old hard reset the entire system
