# Virtual Tour Photos
Editing photos is fairly simple, yet cumbersome. Make sure you have Adobe Photoshop installed.

## Editing photos
1. Right click the image you've taken and open with Photoshop.
2. Drag the square around to crop out unimportant parts of the picture.
3. 
## Resolution
Photos must be saved with a resolution of 640x480. (What year is it again?)  
Basically set either the height or width, whichever is highest to 640 and Photoshop will automagically set the other value so that the photo's respective aspect ratio is kept.
