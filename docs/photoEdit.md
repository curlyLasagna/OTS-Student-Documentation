# Virtual Tour Photos
Editing photos is fairly simple, yet cumbersome. Make sure you have Adobe Photoshop installed.  
Also ensure that you have the original copies of the pictures stored in your One Drive. You have 1TB of free cloud storage, abuse it.

## Directories structure
Dump the unedited pictures in a new folder called "Originals"  
Create a new folder called "Finished", which stores the edited photos

## Editing photos
1. Right click the image you've taken and open with "Adobe Photoshop".
2. Click the Crop Tool ![crop tool](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/icons/SP_Crop_Lg_N_D.png) if it's not set already.
3. Drag the square around to crop out the part that you want to keep.
4. You can also rotate the picture around so that it looks straight.

### Perspective Warp

This tool is useful if you want to modify a picture that was taken at at an angle so that it appears straight.


### Exporting the edited photo

1. Photos must be saved with a resolution of 640x480. (Seriously, what year is it again?)
2. Set the height or width, whichever is highest to 640 and Photoshop will automagically set the other value so that the photo's respective aspect ratio is kept.
3. Save it in the "Finished" folder

#### Setting the title
This is the not so fun part. You can either do the following:

- Manually type out the title and be a chump
- Copy paste from an Excel sheet that I made for this purpose and be a chad

## Uploading edited photos to the production site
> Whatever you do to the Virtual Tour directory will reflect on the actual website, so traverse and modify files with caution

### When there's equipment that has been replaced or removed

1. Create a list of equipment that's been removed from the room.
2. Delete the pictures of the list of equipment that's been removed.
3. Copy over the photos in the "Finished" directory.
   - Click yes to overwrite files with the same title
