This is my personal guide for performing OTS student employee duties. 
This is the way I do things. Consult coordinators for proper process.
I know that [TDNext](https://techhelp.towson.edu/TDNext/Home/Desktop/Default.aspx) has a documentation feature but for something this simple, I don't really want it hosted by a company. Markdown is human readable and portable, so this is fine.
