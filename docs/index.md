## Email template for room access
> Hello Mr/Ms. <insert last name>
My name is <Your name>, OTS student employee
I wanted to inquire about the availability of <room/list of rooms> so I can take photos of the computer equipment of the room to make it easier for our department to troubleshoot in case of an issue. 

Always CC the appropriate coordinator in your emails.  
If unsure, you may CC either [James Hardin](mailto:JHardin@towson.edu) or [Ben Crull](mailto:bcrull@towson.edu)
