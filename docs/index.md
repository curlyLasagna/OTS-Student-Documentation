This is my personal guide for performing OTS duties  
This is the way I do things. Consult coordinators for proper process

## Email template for room access (formal)
> Hello Mr/Ms. <insert last name>
My name is <Your name>, OTS student employee
I wanted to inquire about the availability of <room/list of rooms>   

## Email template for room access (casual)
> Hey <insert first name>
I was wondering if I could have access to <room/list of rooms>

Always CC the appropriate coordinator in your emails.  
If unsure, you may CC either [James Hardin](mailto:JHardin@towson.edu) or [Ben Crull](mailto:bcrull@towson.edu)
