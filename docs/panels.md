## Touch panels on podiums

They just sit on top of the podium, connected to a network cable.

- These panels support [Power over Ethernet](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/Power-over-Ethernet), so a single network cable takes care of communication and powering on the panel.

## Wall panels

As far as I remember, you can take these panels out by hand if you ever have the need to fix it, but if it's not budging, don't try.

### Basic troubleshooting

If these touch panels start acting up, disconnect the network cable from the back of the touch panel

- Some touch panels do require tools to open up from the back

If the touch panels shows an error message, take a picture of the error on the screen before unplugging the network cable.
