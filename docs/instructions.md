# Making instructions

Before I left, there were talks of using Team Dynamix Knowledge Base to host instructions.

In anticipation for this move, I've opted to create instructions that can easily migrate to Knowledge Base. 

I have created web based instructions in a folder called `instructions` at the room of the virtual tour directory. The documentation could be better, which can be found in `README.md`, but I was the only person using it.

You can simply copy and paste the `.html` contents of the instruction to the Knowledge Base rich text editor
