# FAQ about the Virtual Tour

The website is outdated. Refactoring the website is futile.  

It's best to start over.

## What kind of data am I going to be entering?

### Collections

- The number of seats in a classroom with and without a computer in front of it.
- What wireless projector does it use (Mersive or Cisco)
- Door lock type
- Instruction path

### Items

- The different types of equipment in a room
- The TU tag number of computers

## What is Access?

- MS Access is a front end that makes your interaction with the database that we use similar to Excel.
  - Essentially, this is the software that you'll have to use to do your usual [CRUD](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-crud)

### Be wary when using Access

- Any changes you make in Access instantly apply to the actual database.
  - You can't 'undo' your way out of it.
- Personally not a fan of using it.
- If you make a mistake, don't feel bad. You're only adding a piece of paper to the landfill.

## What type of database does the Virtual Tour use?

- A Windows SQL database
- The Virtual Tour uses this database to grab data from. Any changes you make within the **ITEMS** and **COLLECTIONS** tables will be reflected next time the script is run.

## I can't seem to find my way around the shared network directory

- Me neither.
- Creating a shortcut to a directory that you frequently access is the best thing you can do.
