# Solstice Pod down

## Plugging the network cable out and back in

These are some common symptoms that usually get resolved by the above solution

- Time isn't synchronized
- No display
- Frozen

## Pod network cable in the wrong spot

- Pluggin the Solstice Pod in the wrong VLAN is an issue as students connected via tu-secure won't be able to access the pod.

Otherwise, if the above solution doesn't work, then you have a bigger issue at hand, so list the symptoms and report to Ben.
